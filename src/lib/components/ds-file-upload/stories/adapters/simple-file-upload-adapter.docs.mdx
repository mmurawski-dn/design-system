# File Upload

To use the file upload component you need to provide an adapter that implements the `FileUploadAdapter` interface.
See sample adapter below implemented using the native [`XMLHttpRequest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) API but you can also use fetch, axios etc.
