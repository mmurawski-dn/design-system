# Code Review Rules

It is a local code review process done before submitting a PR.

Objectives:

1. Review the current PR diff and flag only clear, high-severity issues
2. Verify requirements and applicable code standards/cursor rules
3. Add short JS comments with a structure:

```typescript
/**
 * REVIEW-[SEVERITY]: [ISSUE DESCRIPTION]
 */
```

- One issue per comment; place on the exact changed line
- Natural tone, specific and actionable; do not mention automated or a high-confidence
- Use emojis: 🚨 Critical 🔒 Security ⚡ Performance ⚠️ Logic ✅ Resolved ✨ Improvement
